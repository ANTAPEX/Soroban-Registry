//! Pure types and rules for contract dependency graphs and transitive risk
//! (Issue #1147).
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic and free of I/O, so the rules that decide
//! *what counts as a risk* and *how risks combine* can be tested exhaustively
//! without a database. The SQL traversal in `api::dependency_graph` and the
//! propagation in `api::dependency_risk` supply rows; this module decides what
//! they mean and in what order they are reported.
//!
//! It lives in `shared`, alongside [`crate::contract_spec`], so every workspace
//! member -- API, CLI, verifier -- shares one definition of the wire shapes and
//! one definition of the rules, and so the rules stay covered by
//! `cargo test -p shared`.
//!
//! ## Two arrays, not one
//!
//! Findings carry a severity; diagnostics do not. A cycle, an unresolved edge,
//! or a truncated traversal is a fact about the *graph*, not a security
//! condition, and giving it a severity would drag `max()` over every cyclic
//! graph up to at least Low -- making "zero findings" unreachable and the whole
//! report useless as a gate. See [`Diagnostic`].
